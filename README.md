# React from the Ground Up

We cover the fundementals of React including
- create a new React App using `npx`
- more about JSX
- how your page's DOM events can interact with State (`onChange`, `onClick`,etc)
- review of `useState()`  & how to avoid mutating state
- more uses of `useEffect()`,  fetch data from a Web Service
- element attributes vs props and how they are related
- create a Custom Component with its own `props` & attributes
- what is prop drilling and various ways it can be handled

There is a branch for every phase of what we covered in the lecture, starting with "1-new-project" (as generated by the React cli).  You can follow along with each of the branches.  The "master" branch is the final application.
